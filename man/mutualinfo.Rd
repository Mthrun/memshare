\title{Mutual Information of continuous and discrete variables.}
\description{
   Return mutual information for a pair of joint variables.
   The variables can either be both numeric, both discrete or a mixture.
   The calculation is done via density estimate whenever necessary (i.e. for the continuous variables).
   The density is estimated via pareto density estimation with subsequent gaussian kernel smoothing.
}
\details{
  Mutual Information is >= 0 and symmetric (in x and y).
  You can think of mutual information as a measure of how much of x's information is contained in y's information
  or put more simply: How much does y predict x.
  Note that mutual information can be compared for pairs that share one variable e.g. (x,y) and (y,z), if MI(x,y) > MI(y,z) then
  x and y are more closely linked than y and z. However given pairs that do not share a variable, e.g. (x,y), (u,v) then MI(x,y) and MI(u,v)
  can not be reasonably compared. In particular: MI defines a partial ordering on the column pairs of a matrix instead of a total ordering (which correlation
  does for example). This is mainly due to MI not being upper-bound and thus is not reasonable put on a scale from 0 to 1.

\arguments{
  \item{x}{[1:n] a numeric vector (not necessarily continuous)}

  \item{isYDiscrete}{Boolean defining whether or not the second numeric vector resembles a continuous or discrete measurement}
  \item{eps}{Scalar, The threshold for which the mutual info summand should be ignored (the limit of the summand for x -> 0 is 0 but the logarithm will be -inf...)}
  \item{useMPMI}{Boolean defining whether or not to use the package MPMI for the calculation (will be used as a baseline)}
